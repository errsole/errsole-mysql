MySQL storage plugin for Errsole. 

## What is Errsole?

Errsole is an open-source logger for Node.js applications. It comes with a built-in log viewer to view, filter, and search your application logs.

If your application uses MySQL as its database or if you prefer storing your application logs in MySQL, you should install both the `errsole` and `errsole-mysql` modules. This setup allows you to store your application logs directly in your MySQL database.
