# errsole-mysql

MySQL storage plugin for Errsole.

## What is Errsole?

Errsole is a Node.js logger with a built-in web dashboard. In this dashboard, you can easily view, filter, and search your app logs.

If your application uses MySQL as its database or if you prefer storing your application logs in MySQL, you should install both the "errsole" and "errsole-mysql" modules. This setup allows you to store your application logs directly in your MySQL database.
